## Project Structure

# Assignment 1

* `task_1.py`: A calculator script that performs basic arithmetic.
* `task_2.py`: A personalized greeting script.

## Functionality

### Task 1: Basic Arithmetic Calculator
This program takes two numeric inputs from the user and performs the following operations:
* **Addition** ($+$)
* **Subtraction** ($-$)
* **Multiplication** ($*$)
* **Division** ($/$)

### Task 2: Personalized Greeting
This script collects the user's first and last name separately and prints a formatted welcome message. It demonstrates:
* Using the `input()` function.
* String handling and output formatting.


# Assignment 2

* `assignment2.py`: A program to check whether a number is odd or even. And a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 50.

## Task 1: Even or Odd Check For Number
**Objective:** Determine whether a given number is even or odd.

**Method:**
- Takes integer input from the user.
- Try dividing the number by 2 to check whether we get any reminder or not.


## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
**Objective:** Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

**Method:**
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50.
- Create a variable and keep adding the value of the iterator to the variable.
