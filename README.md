## Project Structure

* `task_1.py`: A calculator script that performs basic arithmetic.
* `task_2.py`: A personalized greeting script.

## Functionality

### Task 1: Basic Arithmetic Calculator
This program takes two numeric inputs from the user and performs the following operations:
* **Addition** ($+$)
* **Subtraction** ($-$)
* **Multiplication** ($*$)
* **Division** ($/$)



### Task 2: Personalized Greeting
This script collects the user's first and last name separately and prints a formatted welcome message. It demonstrates:
* Using the `input()` function.
* String handling and output formatting.


# Python Programming Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to two basic Python tasks demonstrating the use of conditionals and loops.

## Task 1: Even or Odd Checker
**Objective:** Determine whether a given integer is even or odd.

**Method:**
- Takes integer input from the user.
- Uses an `if-else` statement.
- Checks divisibility using the modulo operator (`%`).

**Example Output:**
Enter an integer: 5  
5 is an Odd number.

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
**Objective:** Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 using a loop.

**Method:**
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50.
- Adds each number to a running total.
- Prints the final sum.

**Example Output:**
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
